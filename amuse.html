      <h3> by Rufta Atsgeba </h3>
        <p>The internet is filled with pictures, texts, and videos that anyone can find something that is amusing and entertaining to them. </p>

          <h2><em>Baby humor</em></h2>
          <p>Thanks to TikTok and YouTube the internet is filled with baby videos and it is my favorite thing in the world. They make me laugh, surprised, and sometimes even scared because of the type of things these babies do.</p>

          <h2><em>Shocking turn</em></h2>
          <p> Like most 20-year-olds in this generation, I love TikTok. I spend most of my time there and this video is a video that really shocked me and I still can't believe it to today</p>

          <h2><em>Humor support</em></h2>
          <p> What I love the most about humor is that it can help people get through rough times.</p>
